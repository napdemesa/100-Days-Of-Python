# 100-Days-Of-Python
Attempting to learn Python and Vim by coding in it for 100 days straight(hopefully).

Day1: This was mostly me messing around in Vim trying to figure it out. That's why I didn't upload it.

Day2: We have the scuffed password generator. Problems with it is that it won't always have an uppercase letter and that I failed trying to make random letters in it uppercase. Learned about capitalize and randomint functions in Python.

Day3: Here is a scuffed equation solver. Will only take 3 command line arguments numbers will be separated by a comma and only takes 3 arguments right now. Learned about partition function in Python.
